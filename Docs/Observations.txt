PEA
===


	PEA	(An)	is optimized: it only requires the An value to be present at the beginning of the EX stage.
	PEA	$xxxx.w	is also optimized; the word->long conversion happens in the EX stage (so the -(sp) calculation can be done in the AG stage).
	PEA	$xxxx.l	is also optimized; the longword is fetched in the EX stage.

	All other forms of PEA decompose into,
	SOURCEUOP <addressing mode>,AguTemp
	STORE  AguTemp,-(SP)
